# Business Valuation Tool

The Business Valuation Tool is a web application built with Flask that helps users perform discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis for business valuation. It allows users to input cash flows and discount rates, generates valuation reports, and supports various analyses like Monte Carlo simulation, sensitivity analysis, and scenario analysis.
